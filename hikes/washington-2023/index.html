            <p>
                When I hike, I like to take a pen and small moleskin to collect
                my thoughts and feelings each night. This 6 day hike of a
                section of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) was a wellspring of
                ideas and perspectives. This log is a short synopsis of a few of
                those thoughts.

                Day 1: Travel Day (☹️) and Ginette Lake
            </h2>

            <h3>Morning</h3>

            <p>
                Originally, this was to be our second day in Washington state.
                However, my 5:48pm flight (on July 15th) was delayed to 7:48pm
                and then further delayed, due to mechanical failures. (This
                reminds me of my last hike to
                <a class="link" href="../colorado-2010">Colorado</a> which also
                had delays.) Unlike that trip, this one was ultimately
                canceled for the next morning. So, after a few more delays, we
                were finally off for Seattle.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hiking partners (trail names: “Bucket” and “Geo”) arrived
                yesterday as planned. Our original plan was to drive from our
                hotel at 6:30am to the ending point of our 65 mile hike at the
                White Pass trailhead. At 11am, we were scheduled to meet a
                (shuttle) driver that we hired to take us and our gear to our
                starting location, Trout Lake trailhead, which would have been a
                3 hour drive. Alas, my flight cancellation nixed that idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, our hike leader (“Bucket”) was considering options and
                opted for an “out and back” hike: start out at White Pass and
                hike as far as we can, then return. When I asked about whether
                we would be able to hike the Knife’s Edge section (considered
                the highlight by many PCT hikers), he noted:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Oh yeah - we’ll do it twice. Less of a warm up and straight into
                the highlight reel. We’ll go south from White Pass (over Knife’s
                Edge on day 2, maybe as far as Walupt Lake), and then we’ll
                return the same way heading north. We’ll have Mt. Adams as our
                beacon on first leg, and Mt. Rainier as our beacon on return
                leg. It will not suck!!!
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                During my flight in, I contemplated this hiking trip. I had high
                hopes for this trip. I tried my best to prepare: hiking the W/OD
                trail with my backpack loaded up with 45 pounds of barbells,
                meticulously recording and weighing each piece of gear,
                preparing my clothes with permethrin. I even taste-tested all of
                my dehydrated meals. I thought, “all that remains is execution.”
                That, and taking each moment to soak in the sights, smells and
                sounds of nature.
            </p>

            <p>I’m amazed at the magnitude of these volcanos from the plane.</p>

            <h3>Early Evening</h3>

            <p>
                After yet <em>another</em> delay at the airport, we finally make
                our way to the trail head. By 5:07pm, we have arrived and I
                quickly change out of my street clothes into my hiking gear. One
                quick picture at the trailhead and we’re off!
            </p>

            <p>
                Given the lateness of our start, we will only get a few miles on
                our trail before we set up camp at Ginette Lake and share a
                ceremonial beer.

            <p>
                I first met Bucket in college at Case Western Reserve University
                (Cleveland, OH). He was a year ahead of me. Though we were both
                among the same friends, we weren’t very close. This hiking
                experience (some 36 years after our time in college) was our
                chance to really get to know each other. Our renewed friendship
                has been one of the biggest <strong>wins</strong> from this
                trip. I plan to do more hikes with Bucket!
            </p>

            <p>
                Geo has been friends with Bucket for many years, meeting soon
                after Bucket left CWRU with his master’s degree. I really
                enjoyed getting to know him as well.

            <p>
                Getting out of your comfort zone does take work. We plan to wake
                at 4:45am to break camp for our first full day of hiking!

                Day 2: Goat Rocks Wilderness (Lutz Lake)
            </h2>

            <h3>Morning</h3>

            <p>
                As I woke at 5:00am (overslept a bit), I could see Geo had
                already broken down his tent. After a hurried breakfast and tear
                down of camp, we were on the trail by 6:15am. While there was no
                rain, the skies were very overcast.

            <p>A couple of quick thoughts on this photo:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>My pack and gear is not looking very streamline.</li>
                <li>
                    Interesting that we are at Twin Peaks trail junction (big
                    fan of David Lynch).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                As we begin our climb, we encounter mist and then rain as the
                temperature drops. Our first sighting (of what will be many) of
                a snowfield.
            </p>

            <p>
                After two hours, we had gained 1000’ over four miles. In my rush
                to pack up my gear, I failed to put my gloves in an accessible
                pocket. As a result, I toughed it out, though my hands were
                getting pretty cold. Thankfully, the next 6 miles were downhill
                and we were sheltered from the wind and rain. We walked through
                portions of the forest that have been ravaged by a recent
                wildfire.

            <h3>Afternoon</h3>

            <p>
                After another 2 miles, we would reach our campsite for the
                night: Lutz Lake. To call Lutz a lake is quite generous. It was
                more like a large, stagnant pond, but it served us well. We
                arrived by 1:00ppm and quickly setup camp.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I was a bit tired (and cold) from the hike, I took a nap in
                my tent. A couple of thoughts were going through my mind:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                I don’t feel like I brought enough warm gear. Here’s hoping that
                tomorrow’s weather is warmer. We only saw blue skies and the sun
                periodically...
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                I don’t think I prepared enough for this hike. I hope that I
                don’t slow down Bucket and Geo too much.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Tomorrow we take on the Knife’s Edge. We will have quite a climb
                ahead of us: 2000’ elevation gain. I am hoping that the views
                are spectacular (as it was hard too see anything today) and that
                it will be warmer...
