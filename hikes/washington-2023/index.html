            <p>
                When I hike, I like to take a pen and small moleskin to collect
                my thoughts and feelings each night. This 6 day hike of a
                section of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) was a wellspring of
                ideas and perspectives. This log is a short synopsis of a few of
                those thoughts.

                Day 1: Travel Day (☹️) and Ginette Lake
            </h2>

            <h3>Morning</h3>

            <p>
                Originally, this was to be our second day in Washington state.
                However, my 5:48pm flight (on July 15th) was delayed to 7:48pm
                and then further delayed, due to mechanical failures. (This
                reminds me of my
                <a class="link" href="../colorado-2010">last hike</a> to
                Colorado which also had delays.) Unlike that trip, this one was
                ultimately canceled for the next morning. So, after a few more
                delays, we were finally off for Seattle.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hiking partners (trail names: “Bucket” and “Geo”) arrived
                yesterday as planned. Our original plan was to drive from our
                hotel at 6:30am to the ending point of our 65 mile hike at the
                White Pass trailhead. At 11am, we were scheduled to meet a
                (shuttle) driver that we hired to take us and our gear to our
                starting location, Trout Lake trailhead, which would have been a
                3 hour drive. Unfortunately, my flight cancellation nixed that
                idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, our hike leader (“Bucket”) was considering options and
                opted for an “out and back” hike: start out at White Pass and
                hike as far as we can, then return. When I asked about whether
                we would be able to hike the Knife’s Edge section (considered
                the highlight by many PCT hikers), he noted:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Oh yeah - we’ll do it twice. Less of a warm up and straight into
                the highlight reel. We’ll go south from White Pass (over Knife’s
                Edge on day 2, maybe as far as Walupt Lake), and then we’ll
                return the same way heading north. We’ll have Mt. Adams as our
                beacon on first leg, and Mt. Rainier as our beacon on return
                leg. It will not suck!!!
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                During my flight in, I thought a lot about this hiking trip. I
                had high hopes. I tried my best to prepare: hiking the W/OD
                trail with my backpack loaded up with 45 pounds of barbells,
                meticulously recording and weighing each piece of gear, and
                preparing my clothes with permethrin. I even taste-tested all of
                my dehydrated meals. I thought, “all that remains is execution.”
                That, and taking each moment to soak in the sights, smells and
                sounds of nature.
            </p>

            <p>I’m amazed at the magnitude of these volcanos from the plane.</p>

            <h3>Early Evening</h3>

            <p>
                After yet <em>another</em> delay at the airport, we finally make
                our way to the trail head. By 5:07pm, we have arrived and I
                quickly changed out of my street clothes and into my hiking
                gear. One quick picture at the trailhead and we’re off!
            </p>

                Given the lateness of our start, we will only get a few miles on
                our trail before we set up camp at Ginette Lake and share a
                ceremonial beer.

            <p>
                I first met Bucket in college at Case Western Reserve University
                (Cleveland, OH). He was a year ahead of me. Though we were both
                among the same friends, we weren’t very close. This hiking
                experience (some 36 years after our time in college) was our
                chance to really get to know each other. Our renewed friendship
                has been one of the biggest <strong>wins</strong> from this
                trip. I plan to do more hikes with Bucket!
            </p>

            <p>
                Geo has been friends with Bucket for many years, meeting soon
                after Bucket left CWRU with his master’s degree. I really
                enjoyed getting to know him as well.

            <p>
                Getting out of your comfort zone does take work. We plan to wake
                at 4:45am to break camp for our first full day of hiking!

                Day 2: Goat Rocks Wilderness (Lutz Lake)
            </h2>

            <h3>Morning</h3>

            <p>
                As I woke at 5:00am (overslept a bit), I could see Geo had
                already broken down his tent. After a hurried breakfast and tear
                down of camp, we were on the trail by 6:15am. While there was no
                rain, the skies were very overcast.

            <div class="image-title">Geo and I hit the trail!</div>

            <p>A couple of quick thoughts on this photo:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>My pack and gear is not looking very streamline.</li>
                <li>
                    Interesting that we are at Twin Peaks trail junction (big
                    fan of David Lynch).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                As we begin our climb, we encounter mist and then rain as the
                temperature drops (perhaps 50° F with wind chill?). Our first
                encounter (of what will be many) with a snowfield.
            </p>

            <p>
                After two hours, we had gained 1000’ over four miles. In my rush
                to pack up my gear, I failed to put my gloves in an accessible
                pocket. As a result, I toughed it out, though my hands were
                getting pretty cold. Thankfully, the next 6 miles were downhill
                and we were sheltered from the wind and rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                We walked through portions of the forest that have been ravaged
                by a recent wildfire.

            <h3>Afternoon</h3>

            <p>
                After another 2 miles, we would reach our campsite for the
                night: Lutz Lake. To call Lutz a lake is quite generous. It was
                more like a large, stagnant pond, but it served us well. We
                arrived by 1:00ppm and quickly setup camp.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I was a bit tired (and cold) from the hike, I took a nap in
                my tent. A couple of thoughts were going through my mind:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                I don’t feel like I brought enough warm gear. Here’s hoping that
                tomorrow’s weather is warmer. We only saw blue skies and the sun
                periodically...
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                I don’t think I prepared enough for this hike. I hope that I
                don’t slow down Bucket and Geo too much.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Tomorrow we take on the Knife’s Edge. We will have quite a climb
                ahead of us: 2000’ elevation gain. I am hoping that the views
                are spectacular (as it was hard too see anything today) and that
                it will be warmer...
            </p>

            <h3>Health Data</h3>
            <p>
                I didn’t mention this in yesterday’s log, but I’ve been
                monitoring the data collected by my Fitbit. Here’s what I did
                for today:
            </p>

            <table class="bio-data">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Steps</th>
                        <th>Miles</th>
                        <th>Calories</th>
                        <th>Zone Minutes</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>26K</td>
                        <td>13.6</td>
                        <td>5.7K</td>
                        <td>426</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                <strong>Zone Minutes</strong> is the number of minutes that your
                heart rate is elevated (at or above Fat Burning, which is above
                40% of your maximum HR). The number of minutes are doubled when
                you are in Cardio (above 60%) or Peak (above 85%) zones.

            <h3>Morning</h3>

            <p>
                With more than 10 hours of sleep, I had plenty of time to get up
                early (4:15am), organize my gear and really ensure that I was
                ready for today’s hike. I had put on three long sleeved shirts
                and felt read for anything. I really had a “spring in my step”
                as we departed at 6:15am.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we began our hike, we quickly warmed up and shed some layers.
                Within the first hour our narrowed view from the trail opened up
                and we started to see some great views.

                As we walked further, the amount of sun exposure increased. We
                found a nice bit of fresh mountain spring water to refill our
                bottles. Geo was so excited, that he dunked his head in the
                water!

                As we took a brief break, I plunked down in a nice field of wild
                flowers for water and a snack.

                As we continued, we could see our path well ahead of us. It
                extended for miles as we approached the Knife’s Edge. In the
                photo below, the path is highlighted in red.

                As we proceeded on our path, you can see where we weould walk
                along the ridgetop of the mountains. This was the Knife’s Edge.
                We have a better picture, up close, as we walked over it on our
                return route (see Day ??).

                We had to make a decision to make. The official trail continues
                to the right and through an extended, steep snowfield. We had
                been advised that it was safer, though perhaps more work, to
                take the “alternate route.” That route, highlighted in green (in
                the prior photo) has us continuing through a very steep pace
                until we get over the ridge, where we can continue downhill.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though no pictures captured this moment, when we reached the
                alternate route junction, I was gassed. I dropped my backpack
                and just sat for an extended time as Geo and Bucket chatted with
                hikers passing by. I was so tired, that I didn’t even get up as
                people came by. ☹️
            </p>

            <p>
                I was thinking about what a serious mistake I had made going on
                this trip. I wasn’t ready, physcially. My heart was really
                pumping and it was getting pretty hot on this exposed mountain
                top. I struggled to swallow my snack of banana chips, my mouth
                so dry. 😩
            </p>

            <p>
                I felt that I needed an “exit plan.” I had told Bucket of my
                exhaustion and how it would be best if they continued without
                me. I could exit the path ahead and they could continue farther
                without me.
            </p>

            <p>
                While they considered the plan, Bucket and Geo offered to carry
                some of my gear. I agreed and then gathered my strength as we
                took the steep alternate route...
