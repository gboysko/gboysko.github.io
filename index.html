      <div class="disclaimer">
        This is the travel log of a 4-day hiking trip in July 2010 (to the
        Indians Peaks Wilderness, near Boulder, Colorado) between some
        co-workers who didn't know a lot about hiking...
      </div>

      <p>
        This is a log of our trip. It's an opportunity for us to recall the
        thoughts we had as it was happening.

      <p>
        Today is a travel day. We all arrive in Denver International Airport and
        begin our journey!

      <blockquote>
        Our (Jitendra and Glenn's) flight is delayed by 45 minutes due to
        'mechanical failures'. Hopefully it is not an omen of bad things to
        come. We were separated by a grandfather from Ethiopia (dressed in
        traditional garb) who spoke no English and seemed very unaccustomed to
        western culture (let alone airline travel). He is completely perplexed
        by the Coke can and seat belts.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>They are joined by Gunther at the airport with his size 14 boots!</p>

      <p>
        After collecting our luggage and returning to the parking lot, Gunther
        is surprised to see it raining. It was clear when he arrived a few hours
        ago.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I arrived a couple of hours before Glenn &amp; Jitu. I spent some time
        in the bookstore reading, then picked up the rental car and parked it
        just outside the terminal.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

      <p>
        Our first stop is at the local REI store in Boulder for canister fuel
        and supplies. Next, we travel to Whole Foods for fresh groceries and
        speak with a local clerk who gives us recommendations for dinner.
        "Sunflower Restaurant" is recommended as the place to go for good
        healthy food.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, we are unable to find this restaurant, though we find the
        "Sunflower" Farmer's Market (which is an upscale grocery store like
        Whole Foods). We learn that it has since closed. We luckily find the
        town square in Boulder (near Pearl Street) featuring plenty of
        restaurants, one of which is a Nepalese restaurant (aptly named
        "Himalayas Restaurant").
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Despite featuring a specialty of yak, we opt for a large veggie meal. In
        retrospect, we should have probably opted for something lighter.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The meal tasted good, better than I was expecting. Even the rice pudding
        was good.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      </h3>

      <p>
        Finally, the drive up the mountains to 8,000+ feet of elevation to
        Nederland, CO. We find the log cabin-styled Best Western Inn and
        checkin. When we tell of our plans to spend 4 days in Indian Peaks
        Wilderness Area, our hotel attendant tells us slowly that we are in the
        midst of "monsoon season." She said to expect rain at 2:00pm each day.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I remember telling the guys, 'We have ponchos and rain gear, so we
        should be OK.' Famous last words.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Later that night, we all get together to organize our backpacks. We
        don't get to sleep until about 1am. Gunther is relieved to have "white
        noise" (in the form of a fan) to help him sleep.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Before the trip, I had thought that getting an early night of solid
        sleep at the start was critical to our success. But it was pretty clear
        once we started the final backpack organization that we would be up
        late. This concerned me, but I figured I would just make up for it the
        next night.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Gunther advises that we should "take it easy" on the first day. Seems
        like good advice, but it is easily trumped by the old adage of 'the
        early bird gets the worm'. Our first major challenge is to get at least
        6 miles into the back country before the rain. We shoot for being on the
        Pawnee Trail by 8am.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Joking with Gunther, I recite a famous line from Michael Bluth of
        Arrested Development, 'I think I have made a horrible mistake.'<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn

      <h3 id="toc5"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-Morning"></a>Morning</h3>

      <p>
        By 6:45am, we are all promptly dressed and ready for our first day of
        hiking. We head down to the lobby for our continental breakfast, but
        learn that breakfast isn't available until 7am. Drats!
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        None of us got tons of sleep, due to our late bedtime, but Glenn had not
        slept well. He said he had been watching the clock, waiting for morning,
        unable to fall asleep. I fell asleep within 10 minutes. Jitu also said
        he had not slept well. He &amp; Glenn were possibly being affected by
        the altitude.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Waiting outside for breakfast to start, we are relieved to feel how
        comfortable the weather is. We had heard that it could drop to freezing
        overnight and thought it would be much colder. It is probably in the
        low- to mid-60s.
      </p>

      <p>
        It takes a bit longer to finish breakfast and checkout. We don't leave
        the hotel until 8am and don't arrive at Long Lake parking lot until
        8:30am (after climbing another 2,000 feet). We are floored by the beauty
        of the surrounding mountains. After a final bathroom break and photos,
        we are finally ready to head out on the trail. 8:55am. Four miles to
        Pawnee Pass (the Continental Divide, 12,541 feet).

      <div class="image-title">Jitendra and Glenn in Long Lake parking lot</div>

      <p>
        The early portions of the trail are very easy. We see many beautiful
        sights, including Lake Isabelle.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Glenn led in the front, followed by Jitu, then me in the back. For some
        reason, that is the order we maintained throughout the entire trip. I
        had the camera and often paused to snap pictures, so I was often far
        behind, but it wasn't really a problem.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        By around 10:15am, we start our ascent of Pawnee Pass in earnest. The
        switchbacks are very steep. We cross some very rocky terrain as well as
        snow fields. Instead of stopping for lunch at noon, we soldier on
        towards the pass.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Some day hikers (with no backpacks) passed us while we paused on the
        trail. Most were friendly and would briefly chat with Glenn, asking
        where we were headed. One slightly older gentleman said he had done the
        same route we were attempting back when he was 'young and stupid'.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <blockquote>
        Approaching the pass was physically demanding. The steep switchbacks,
        the weight of the backpacks, the altitude -- all of it was hurting us.
        We had to pause frequently to catch our breath and rest our legs. Glenn
        reported feeling dizzy. My legs were very sore and my breathing was very
        labored. Once we would pause, my legs felt fine and my breathing would
        return to normal. But then the moment we resumed walking, I was
        immediately panting and sore again. It felt very much like the final
        stretch of a half marathon, so I just concentrated on putting one foot
        in front of the other, and enjoying the scenery.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther

      <p>
        At exactly 1:00pm, we arrive at Pawnee Pass and the Continental Divide.
        It is very cold (~40°F) and windy. We are greeted by 3 campers who
        stayed at Pawnee Lake the night before. The only man of the three
        (probably in his late 50s) tells of us some amazing sights as we cross
        down into the valley.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        He said it is probably the most amazing climb we are likely to ever see,

        The descent on Pawnee Trail is by far the rockiest I've ever seen. Huge
        boulder fields with a very narrow trail. The campers we left at the
        Continental Divide warned us of rock slides they heard the night before.
        I'm not surprised.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I loved this descent. What a spectacular view. Even photos don't do it
        justice. I told Glenn &amp; Jitu that it was better than anything I
        could've hoped for. At this point all of us were in good spirits,
        relieved to be done with the uphill, and impressed by the view. I didn't
        realize yet how badly thing would turn soon.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        The views are quite amazing at this elevation and we can clearly see
        Pawnee Lake below. From our best guess, the lake is about 1-2 miles
        ahead. We see dark clouds forming and showers falling like sheets on the
        lake.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I told the guys that we can see the rain below and there is no need to
        get any closer. Let's keep a safe distance from Pawnee Lake and try to
        wait it out.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Within a few minutes, the droplets began. We begin to don our rain gear.
        Just like the hotel attendant warned us last night. At this point, we
        are probably at ~12,000 feet.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I saw a lightning flash in the distance and suggested that we move

        The wind really picked up and the rain changed direction. Instead of
        moving north, it started to moving east directly towards us, up the
        mountain. The winds really start to pickup.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I remember seeing the heavy fog and rain heading directly towards us. It
        looked very foreboding. We were so high up the mountain that the top of
        the fog was at eye level. I thought we were in for quiet a test.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I remember that Gunther suggested that while we wait, perhaps we should
        eat. Instantly I thought about the real danger we faced was not lack of
        food, or lack of water, but lack of heat. I told him we should pass for
        now. --Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was concerned about skipping/postponing lunch because I typically get
        headaches that way. But it started becoming apparent to me that the
        storm was now our biggest concern. Previously our visibility was
        probably many miles. Within the last half hour, it had dropped to about
        100 feet. That's how thick the fog and rain were.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <h3 id="toc9"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-2:45pm"></a>2:45pm</h3>

      <p>
        The rain was not letting up and the ponchos that Gunther and Glenn were
        wearing did not seem to be keeping their bodies dry. Their shorts and
        legs were still getting very wet. Still at a temperature in the low 50s,
        we decided to resume our hike (in the rain) in an effort to stay warm,
        reach tree line (~10,000ft) and perhaps get through the rain earlier
        than at the summit.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As we hiked down the mountain, my boots were started to fill up with
        water. My feet were slushing as I walked. This was not good.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The fog was so thick I couldn't even see Glenn. I could only see Jitu,
        and I hoped he could still see Glenn. Sometimes if I slipped and fell
        behind, I would temporarily even lose sight of Jitu. But hiking fast was
        not really an option. The rain made the trail very slippery, and my legs
        were getting noticeably clumsy from fatigue. I could no longer place my
        feet firmly and tripped frequently. My hands and feet were also getting
        numb from the cold, and I could feel a headache coming on. Not good.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther

      <p>
        We are still walking in the rain and quickly convene to speak. Jitendra
        notes that we should stop by 4:00pm, no matter what, to setup camp.
        Glenn urged us to continue on.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Everywhere I looked, I saw either a stream of water or water rolling
        over the grass. How could I setup a tent here!? That would be suicide.
        We would be swimming in our sleeping bags. It looked like a completely
        inhabitable place to setup a tent. I really began to wonder where I was
        going to find a campsite anywhere near here.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was impressed by Glenn and Jitu's fortitude. I knew they must be
        hurting like I was, but no one said a word about it. No complaints. We
        just talked about the plan and about setting up camp.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <p>
        More rain, but we were well within tree line. Time to start to getting
        cover from the rain by trees.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        By this time, I notice my hands swelling. It was getting hard to make a
        fist. As I try to pick up my pace, my feet are getting clumsy. I start
        stumbling. I began to rehearse in my mind the steps I needed to follow
        to keep these guys alive: setup a tent, strip off all of our wet
        clothes, get into bags quickly to raise our core body temperature.
        Nothing else mattered, at all.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <h3 id="toc12"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-4:05pm"></a>4:05pm</h3>

      <p>
        We find a small clearing (about 6 feet by 6 feet) within a foot or so
        off the trail. It is just big enough to setup a tent and is not covered
        in water. It overlooks a small cliff and stream below. We are still
        somewhat high: about 10,750 feet.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        It is completely in violation of back country camping regulations
        (campers are asked to setup tents at least 100' off the trail), but I'm
        already rehearsing what I'd tell a ranger if he were to come by.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        As we setup the tent, I see Gunther start to shiver uncontrollably. I am
        asking him to repeatedly put the tent pole in the 'bottom hole', but he
        is struggling to understand. I was really starting to worry, especially
        given that the nights are supposed to get into the 30s.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        As we approached the spot where we would set up the tent, he asked if
        anyone was shivering. Jitu and I both said no. But within minutes, I
        started shivering big time. Once I stopped walking and got my backpack
        off, I realized what bad shape I was in. My shoulders were on fire and
        my hands numb, which made it hard to help with the tent. Worst of all my
        headache was now a throbbing migraine, which made it almost impossible
        to concentrate on even the simplest task.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Glenn's tent goes up without much problem and Jitendra (new to camping)
        considers setting his tent up nearby. The small space that remains is on
        a very steep slant (perhaps 30°) and Glenn advises against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily, almost as soon as we finishing setting up our tent, the rain
        lets up.
      </p>

      <p>
        We quickly fill our 2 man tent with 3 and work to get our core body
        temperatures up.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As I laid in my bag, I felt we narrowly avoided a really disastrous
        event. If we didn't find this tent when we did, I really don't know if
        we would make it. I still feared for the worst. If we don't get
        completely dry by nightfall, we could still be in for trouble.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        With 3 adults inside, the tent got really warm quickly. Jitu and I were
        so sore that we didn't even bother discarding all our wet clothes, we
        just got into our bags. It's hard to describe how tired we were. We
        tried to avoid any unnecessary tasks or movement. We all just wanted to
        lay still and rest.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        Our emergency campsite, only feet off of the trail: a gross violation of
        camping etiquette
      </div>

      <h3 id="toc13"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-~5:30pm"></a>~5:30pm</h3>

      <p>
        After restoring our bodies with a little rest, we needed to still take
        care of many tasks that evening: hanging clothes to dry (with what
        little sunlight there was), filtering water, eating dinner, and
        preparing a "bear bag" by hanging a backpack of food 8-10' above the
        ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jitendra was starting to feel nauseous, perhaps the onset of AMS
        (Altitude Mountain Sickness), we had gone from ~8,000 feet (in
        Nederland) to 12,500 feet (at Pawnee Pass). That was more elevation than
        we were accustomed to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Glenn made dinner (Red Thai Curry with soy nuts) while Jitendra and
        Gunther filtered water from the nearby stream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dinner was a bit spicy, but it was something. After dinner, Glenn began
        to feel a bit sick as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        During cleanup, Glenn asked Gunther to use the Brillo pad (which was in
        the plastic Ziploc bag) to scrub the pot. Obviously, Gunther was still
        not fully "together" as he began to scrub the pot with the Brillo pad
        still in the bag.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I remember telling Gunther, 'Dude, you've got to take the pad out of the
        bag.' and thought about what I've got myself into. I could really be in
        water well over my head. This was the first camping trip for Gunther and
        only the second since college for Jitendra.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was in bad shape; my head worst of all. I couldn't think, due to my
        migraine. When Glenn handed me the Brillo pad in a Ziploc, I figured it
        must be some sort of clever camping trick. It didn't occur to me to take
        the pad out of the Ziploc.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Despite my mental stupor, I began to notice that my colleagues weren't
        doing well either. They now both seemed to be affected by the altitude.
        In a way, I was sort of relieved, because I didn't want to be the sole
        person who slowed the trip down. We even brought up the topic of
        shortening the trip (but realized that was logistically impossible). I
        began picturing myself carrying one of the guys back to the car.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In the process of climbing a boulder to get access to a tree limb (for
        the bear bag), Glenn fell about 6 feet and over extended his left
        shoulder. Small cut on his hand.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I've always known that Glenn is great at keeping calm in difficult
        situations, but this day he really outdid himself. After making it
        through the storm, weathering a near-disaster, and now seeing him fall,
        I thought for sure he would finally lose his cool. But he didn't. He
        just sat quietly for a minute, attending to his injured arm, and then
        without saying a word, got back up and kept on working with the bear
        bag.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <h3 id="toc14"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-8:30pm"></a>8:30pm</h3>

      <p>
        Not much sunlight left, so Glenn resorts to hanging the bear bag
        directly over the trail.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Again a gross violation of the camping code, but at this point, I doubt
        we will find any campers, let alone a ranger inspecting the trail. Even
        if a ranger did come by, that would probably not be the worst thing to
        happen.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <h3 id="toc15"><a name="Wednesday, July 21, 2010-9:00m"></a>9:00m</h3>

      <p>
        Instead of opting to setup a second tent, Glenn decides to have all 3
        men in the 2 man tent. And this time, we include all of the remaining
        backpacks. It is so crowded that we sleep in alternating directions
        (head to feet).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I had an absolutely horrible night of sleep. My mind was just racing
        about what I should be doing next, what scenarios I should plan for and
        what lie ahead. To make matters worse, as soon as I finished scribbling
        in my notebook, Jitendra began to snore. I had previous experience
        sharing a room with G2 during MicroStrategy World 2009. He kept me up
        all night that trip as well. Worst of all, I contemplated the thought
        that there is really no shortcut out of here. If we felt one of us could
        not go on, there is no way out, but up Pawnee Pass again. If one of us
        was feeling sick, it would take us a full day to get back to the car.
        That thought really concerned me.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        As the night went on, I really thought that I might literally get no
        sleep at all. Not a single minute. I don't know how many times I
        rearranged. Around 3am, I fumbled in the dark for the first aid kit for
        3 Ibuprofen and swallowed them. No luck.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Jitendra's snoring is really quite amazing. He's like a one man
        orchestra. So many different sounds and timbres. He can even do
        impressions! I thought for sure I heard a bear outside our tent. My
        senses perked up even more as the snuffles and snorts continued. Within
        a second, I turned and heard it was coming from G2. Amazing. If there is
        one thing I am going to accomplish tomorrow, it is to find a great
        campsite where we can setup two tents!<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I slept pretty well, all things considered. By this point I was
        practically crippled by my throbbing migraine. I knew from past
        experience that the only thing that would relieve it was solid sleep. So
        I was determined to sleep; nothing else mattered. We were packed in like
        sardines; the tent was now very hot inside; every time someone even
        slightly budged, we could all feel it; Jitu had warned us about snoring;
        Glenn said we should record our thoughts in a journal; none of us were
        sure what kind of wildlife to expect overnight -- none of that mattered
        to me anymore. I needed sleep ASAP. Luckily I had just spent a week on
        vacation sleeping with my kids, so I had gotten used to sleeping
        uncomfortably. So I slept. Sure, we woke each other up frequently
        throughout the night, but each time I would go right back to sleep. I
        was determined. I thought: if I wake up the next morning and my migraine
        isn't gone, I don't know how I'm going to continue this trip.<br /><br />&ndash;

        After a rough night of trying to sleep, I was ready to get up at the
        first crack of dawn. 5:15am came I made my way out of tent. My footwear
        was still very wet from the night before so I just wrung out my socks,
        put them on, laced the boots up and was ready to go. The SmartWool socks
        were really great--they warmed up pretty fast.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        This was the make-or-break moment of the trip for me. I gently slowly
        got up and waited to see how my head felt. With a HUGE sense of relief I
        realized my migrane was gone! It was a miracle. I was so thrilled. As
        long as my head was clear, I felt ready to handle any amount of physical
        exhaustion. In fact, I was surprised to find that I didn't feel any
        soreness or leftover fatigue from the previous day. Then I was doubly
        thrilled when I asked Jitu how he felt and he too had miraculously
        recovered. That's when I knew everything would be all right.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        By 6am, the entire team was up, we assembled for breakfast (a
        super-duper blend of oatmeal, wheat germ, dried milk, brown sugar and
        dried apples), cleaned dishes, pumped water and broke camp.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I snapped a few photos of our 'camp site'. It was the first time I'd
        taken the camera out since stuffing it away when the monsoon hit us the
        previous afernoon. The photos say 5:15am so it's possible we all got up
        early (unless it's a time-zone difference).<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I had lots of oatmeal for breakfast; too much, I would later discover.
        Glenn &amp; Jitu ate some but there was still lots leftover, and I felt
        bad tossing it, so I ate probably 3 bowls worth. Note to self: don't do
        that when you are days away from a toilet.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        By 8am, we were on the trail and were resolute in arriving at our next
        campsite before 1pm.

      <p>
        Only two and half hours into our hiking and we have already covered 4
        miles. Beautiful blue skies above as our trek took us largely downhill.
        We ended Pawnee Pass trail at around 10,000 feet and winded through the
        woods of Cascade Creek Trail.

        Since it was downhill, our pace was quite quick. We were all in good
        spirits. I got so used to the downhill that I didn't sufficiently
        prepare myself for the upcoming uphill.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        By the end of Cascade Creek, we had reached probably the lowest
        elevation of the entire trip: 8,750 feet. At this point, made our way up
        the Buchanan Pass Trail. Almost immediately, it was a straight uphill
        slog.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I remember thinking, 'we made such great progress and now we're back to
        climbing'. I guess that's the nature of this trip. It's the journey and
        not the destination.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I too felt a little disheartened when the uphill began. It immediately
        made me pant and made my hips sore; much like the previous day. But at
        least my migrane was long gone, and that made me feel I could handle
        anything. So I picked a sustainable pace for myself and forged onward.
        Glenn &amp; Jitu began the uphill at a much faster pace that I knew I
        could not sustain. So I just told myself not to worry and to follow my
        own instincts (a trick I frequently use in running races). Luckily the
        two guys soon slowed down to something more manageable. Still I was
        inspired by their enthusiasm and perseverance. These guys were not
        screwing around!<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        We climbed Buchanan Pass Trail, gaining about 1,000 feet of elevation.
        After crossing Buchanan Creek (with Glenn accidentally falling in the
        water), we started up another set of switchbacks. It was not clear where
        we were (exactly) and decided to fall back to find a campsite for fear
        of the approaching rain.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        We did many water crossings on this trip, so I'm not sure when exactly
        this one happened, but at some point, we reached a creek that seemed
        impossible to cross without getting wet. That may not sound like such a
        big deal, but when you're away from civilization and carrying a 40lb
        pack, it is a big deal. I remember this particular crossing because I
        volunteered to go first. 'Really?' asked Glenn. 'You feel pretty
        balanced with your pack on?' 'Heck, no!' I laughed. Then I mumbled: 'But
        I have a knack for trying things for which I am woefully unprepared with
        great enthusiasm!' I doubt Glenn even heard me mumble over the loud rush
        of the water, but I remember this exchange because it reminds me of how
        good my spirits were after we'd survived that first day. (We did all
        make it across the creek okay, although Jitu lost his sunglasses.)<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I remember the decision to fall back. The switchbacks had surprised me
        and I asked Glenn if we could consult the map again. I thought we had
        either made much more progress than I expected, or we had made
        heartbreakingly little progress. Turns out it was the former, not the
        latter, but at the time I wasn't sure. It felt discouraging to fall
        back, but if we didn't, there was a chance we would have to camp at high
        altitude and far from a water source.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        By this time, my feet were absolutely killing me. Hiking in wet boots
        and socks is really tough on your feet. By the time I got to camp and
        got my boots off, I could see that one of my toe nails was already black
        and blue. I had a backup pair of dry socks, but felt that the wet boots
        would just wet my dry socks. Next time, I'll keep my boots dry at all
        times.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After backtracking a bit, we found a great campsite overlooking a
        meadow. Absolutely a beautiful view with water nearby. It even had a
        firepit (Deluxe!).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Glenn scouted for a camp site near water. I thought, if he gets lucky,
        maybe he'll find us a decent flat patch of grass. Instead he found this
        great camp site that was an easy walk from the water yet still secluded,
        complete with an overlook and a firepit. Jitu and I were very happy with
        our guide.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We promptly setup our two tents and dried our wet clothes on rocks. We
        waited for the rain, but it never came.

        Glenn, exhausted from the prior night and today's hike, tried to take a
        later afternoon nap. That would be come the team's schedule: get up
        early (5am), hike for 6-7 hours, setup camp, and rest. The rest of the
        day would be spent on meals, firewood, purifying water and closing down
        camp for the night.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As I laid in the toaster oven that was our tent, my primary goal was
        just to get off my feet (now throbbing). Gunther said I would soon loose
        my toe nail. How would my feet fare the remaining two days? Again, I'm
        struck by what a difficult situation we are making for ourselves. At
        this point in the trip, we are about 15 miles from our car with two
        summits to climb. There is no shorter way back, no corners to cut, just
        our full route. I struggled with the nagging defeatist attitude deep in
        the back of my mind.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was really surprised when Glenn crashed in the tent. That's how good
        he was at hiding his struggles. I hadn't noticed any signs that he was
        hurting either physically or mentally. I felt bad for him when he told
        me about his feet; I know that doesn't feel good (I eventually lost 3
        toenails due to the last day of this trip). I don't nap during the day,
        and I don't like to lie down if I'm not intending to sleep, so I mostly
        just rested, wrote a letter to Kim and tried to give Glenn some
        quiet.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        Glenn handed over dinner responsibilities over to Jitendra and Gunther.
        They learned about how to use the stove and prepare the meal (which was
        Mango Curry with Rice and Lentils).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Trying to sleep was really difficult. As I started to doze off, my
        breathing became shallower and shallower until I woke up with a gasp
        trying to catch my breath. It was really quite frustrating.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The instructions for the rice said to boil for 4 minutes. This surprised
        me; I've only ever cooked rice that took 20 minutes. After 4 minutes I
        showed the rice to Jitu for a second opinion. We both agreed to let it
        cook for 20 minutes, after which it looked and tasted fine. I was glad
        that Glenn had previously shown me how to use the stove, and happy to
        finally make myself useful (for perhaps the first time on this trip) and
        give Glenn a chance to rest; but later disappointed to hear that he had
        trouble napping. I also felt bad that I was no help to Glenn in getting
        the fire going. Nevertheless he still got it done without problems and
        we all enjoyed it.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The team would not see any rain that day. All of our wet clothes from
        the previous night had been dried either on the clothesline or large
        rocks and we were starting to restore ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The curry was good, but very, very spicy. Much of it was left over and
        had to be buried. For dessert, Glenn introduced the guys to S'mores.
        Even Gunther ate them!

      <blockquote>
        According to the photos, I believe this is when we saw our first deer. I
        was packing up by the tent, Glenn and Jitu were by the creek pumping
        water. I then heard Jitu approaching and calling out, 'Hey! Hey!' so I
        turned around and saw the deer. It had been approaching the camp site
        until it was scared by Jitu. But it didn't run away entirely; it just
        got behind some trees and watched us. I ran to get my camera and took
        pictures while it stayed put. I even used the flash and it still didn't
        run away. It stared at us very intently; we both commented that it was a
        little odd. Even after I used the flash it still resumed its approach.
        Then finally it began to lose interest and ran off. I was thrilled.<br /><br />&ndash;

        We hit the trail. Glenn's feet are much better in dry boots and socks.
        We took on ~1,800 feet of ascent in 2 1/2 hours. A fawn crossed our path
        and with huge bounding strides, effortlessly flew down the mountain side
        over fallen logs and between trees. It was really quite amazing.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Once again I was delighted. I love seeing wildlife in the wild, and this
        fawn in particular was so graceful. To see something that big and strong
        moving that fast and lightly on its feet, practically flying thru the
        air... words can't even describe it. It was surreal.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <p>
        We crossed through some of the most beautiful meadows of the entire trip
        at Fox Park. We saw a male and female deer grazing at ~10,750 feet.

        Again, words (and even pictures) can't do these meadows justice. It's as
        if we walked thru an undiscovered paradise that lies on a pseudo-plateau
        near the roof of the rockies. It was idyllic. Lush greenery, colorful
        flowers, and even sheets of ice and snow that hadn't melted away yet. In
        the distance was the steep climb across the Continental Divide, and I
        knew we had to keep moving, but I found myself wishing we could set up
        camp here and visit for a day. I felt privileged to witness this little
        corner of the world, even if only briefly.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        By 11,000 feet, beyond tree cover, the wind blew through us at around 40
        mph. The high winds caused the temperature to drop from the 70s at the
        beginning of the high into the 40s.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I had a tee shirt on the beginning of the hike which I promptly sweated
        up. With the wind blowing through me, it just started to freeze my back.
        I was so thankful when I put on my black Under Armor sweatshirt and
        cap.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn

      <p>
        We made our way towards Buchanan Pass where we crossed the Continental
        Divide for a second time (this time from West to East), this time at
        11,837 feet.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The climb to the top was just so steep. It had to be greater than 45
        degrees.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>The wind began to pick up even more (to about 50mph).</p>

      <blockquote>
        Thankfully, the wind was at our back, pushing us forward; otherwise, I
        don't know how we would have made that climb.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was thinking the same thing as we ascended: thank goodness the wind is
        at our back! I couldn't believe how strong it was. With packs on, it was
        certainly strong enough to knock us off-balance. I wondered, could this
        be 30mph? 40mph? even more? But I didn't want to ask because I didn't
        want to complain. So I was relieved when, after reaching the summit,
        Glenn asked me, 'Do you think this might be 40mph? maybe 50mph?'<br /><br />&ndash;
        Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        At the summit, we quickly took a few pictures, but given the conditions,
        we absolutely raced to get down to the other side of the mountain.
        Within a few minutes, we were below the wind and immediately warmed up.

        The team stopped for an extended break on the way down the mountain,
        giddy with excitement for what they had just accomplished. They had
        plenty of water and a few energy bars
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I felt like such a weight had been lifted off me. We had made our way

        punishment we put them through. I felt incredibly upbeat.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <blockquote>
        Ironically, the team seemed to be getting stronger each day. I figured
        we might get conditioned to the physical challenges, but I didn't expect
        it to happen so soon. I also thought living on water &amp; power bars
        would be sub-optimal. But somehow we seemed to keep improving our pace
        and our endurance each day. I was quite proud of our team.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <p>
        Again during the descent of Buchanan Pass Trail, the team picked up its
        pace. They had hiked so fast, that they entirely missed the sign for the
        next trail (Beaver Creek Trail), but found themselves on it nonetheless.
      </p>

      <h3 id="toc26"><a name="Friday, July 23, 2010-12:30pm"></a>12:30pm</h3>

      <p>
        In about 5 hours, the team covered 7+ miles of trail. They found
        themselves at the Coney Flats trail head. Coming as a complete surprise
        to the team, Coney Flats was accessible from a dirt road. A few cars
        were parked in a small lot at the trail head. The trail followed the
        road for about about a 1/4 mile with about 6-8 connecting campsites.
      </p>

      <p>
        The campsites, though well established, were horribly mistreated. The
        fire pits had melted glass bottles; the surrounding trees were severely
        butchered with an axe or machete (presumably for firewood); some pits
        even had mounds of trash (discarded large plastic water jugs, junk food
        bags, etc).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        If a campsite could speak, I feel it would have told me horrible stories
        of the torture it endured. It really look quite scary.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The team finished off its last lunch of the trip (tuna fish salad on
        pita bread, soy nuts and a great Dutch cheese called Robusto) and setup
        tents. Again, they had great access to a nearby stream with a beautiful
        view of Sawtooth mountain.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I was really surprised that there weren't more campers in our area with
        us. There was dirt road access which made 'car camping' very easy and
        the weather was beautiful. I really expected us to have neighbors very
        soon.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After setup, some passing backpackers came by our campsite. A young man
        in his late twenties told us about how he had camped in our site just
        the week before. He was quite concerned as he told us that during his
        visit, while making a fire in the pit, he found bullets in the ashes.
        22-caliber bullets. He cautioned us that these weren't simply the
        shells, but unfired bullets. He asked us, "What kind of person leaves
        unfired bullets in a fire pit?". We all looked around puzzled. He said
        that he cleared out the fire pit as well as he could (discarding the
        bullets in a bush nearby), but that we should be aware of that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later in the day, the team heard a vehicle coming through the dirt road.
        But riding off to where? The dirt road seemingly ended in a stream. They
        soon learned that the vehicle was not a car or truck, but an ATV, which
        drove through the stream and on to the other side. A somewhat overweight
        young woman rode through and our campsite stood in stark contrast to the
        one from the night before. Last night's was pristine, wholly natural and
        remote. This one, was quite the opposite.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a short nap, the team regrouped and chatted about the trip thus
        far: their hopes for the trip and how they were all feeling at the time.
        They talked openly and for a while on the challenges of being a father
        and husband and their various upbringings.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        These conversations were an obvious highlight of the trip for me. I
        would later tell my wife that this trip was so different than her
        'girls-only' hiking trip to the Grand Canyon. In her trip, the focus was
        on social interaction. In this trip, this was the first time we had
        personal conversations. Previously, we had mostly limited our talking to
        logistics (read: survival). Plus, we had frequently been hiking in
        conditions that would have made conversation difficult (rushing waters,
        powerful winds, storms, exhausting uphills). So it wasn't until this
        final night of camping that we even got around to talking meaningfully
        about family &amp; work.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The time to prepare dinner quickly came and went. The team chose to skip
        dinner for the night (no one was very hungry and Gunther was having some
        GI-related problems) and even spoke about the idea of skipping breakfast
        in favor of eating the remaining Robusto cheese. Jitendra and Gunther
        felt that there was so much work involved in meal preparation, they
        preferred to skip it in favor of an earlier return home. Glenn objected,
        but consented in the end.

        given our caloric output, but it was almost the end of the trip and we

        camp site, and cleared up in time for bed. So all things considered, I
        was very lucky. Note to self for future reference: there are worse

      <h3 id="toc27"><a name="Friday, July 23, 2010-Evening"></a>Evening</h3>

      <p>
        Looking through the woods for firewood, Glenn was surprised to see so
        much animal droppings. Large piles of it in the woods surrounding our
        campsite. Was it bear scat or moose scat? (At the time, he felt it was
        from a bear or many bears, but later learned [at home] it was from a
        moose. This would make sense given how close the campsites were to the
        stream.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The night was really beautiful. Glenn organized a short hike at dusk
        around the surrounding area where he found footprints of a large animal.
        It seemed to be elk, but it could have been moose as well. After short
        periods of silence, hoping to find an approaching animal, the team found
        none.
      </p>

      <p>
        They walked back to the campsite under the full moon. Jitendra asked
        whether it would affect nearby animals. Would they see any wildlife that
        night? Anytime unexpected from the moon?
      </p>

      <p>
        The team went to sleep for the night around 9:00pm. By 9:15pm, Glenn had
        finished writing in his journal and started to hear some approaching
        sounds.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I was shocked to hear a vehicle approaching in the distance. I heard
        loud male voices shouting excitedly and music blaring out of a car
        stereo. Still miles from our campsite, I wasn't sure how close they'd
        get.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The vehicle continued to approach and eventually stopped. It would
        appear that the team would have neighbors after all. But who comes out
        for camping after the sun has already gone down? The visitors seemed to
        stop for about 15-20 minutes. Eventually, the vehicle turned over again
        and was headed down the dirt road, in our direction, to the stream.
        Again, the music blared and it appeared the visitors would be "fueled"
        by alcohol (if the campsites were any indication who used them).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I laid in my sleeping bag very still. The car or truck was probably
        about 25 feet from our campsite. I anticipated what I'd say if anyone
        came towards our tents: 'Guys, we don't want any trouble here' or 'We
        are trying to enjoy nature here, boys, can you give us a break?'. It
        sounded lame, even in my head, but I had no idea what these guys were
        doing. Could this get any weirder.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Eventually, the vehicle left the dirt road near our campsite and either
        slowly forded the stream or returned back. It was not clear.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        For a long time, I listened so intently on the vehicle. Was it
        returning? Was that the end of our night? With all of the scat near our
        campsite, I told the guys to anticipate animals visiting at night. There
        was simply too much of it to assume there were no animals nearby.
        Eventually, I fell asleep, but was on alert, at least subconsciously.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I slept fine. I heard the people and the vehicle and the stereo, but I
        just decided I couldn't care less. I was determined to sleep. (Much like
        that first night camping after the storm!) I briefly considered that we
        could be in trouble, but I just didn't have the energy to care. I also
        figured that if anybody did dare to interrupt my sleep and hassle us, I
        would wake up in such a fury that it was THEY who should be worried. I
        get really cranky when I don't get enough sleep. :-) <br /><br />&ndash;

      <p>
        By the third morning, Glenn had learned that his heart rate monitor
        watch (which was used to keep time for the trip due to its waterproof
        nature) had an alarm feature! So, promptly at 5:00am, the team awoke to
        start the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what should the team find at 5am, but another vehicle approaching!
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I was certain it was a Forest Ranger, coming to talk to us about the
        disturbance last night. I anticipated the stories of havoc created by
        these rowdies.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        However, instead of a car or truck, it was another ATV! And that's when
        it dawned on Glenn who these people where.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Of course, I realized they were hunters. Our trail seemed to be on the
        border of some sort of hunting zone. The ATVs were used by the hunters
        to get into the woods and through streams. They arrived the night before
        simply to get an early start on the day. The vehicles we heard at 5am
        had to be the hunters driving into woods for a full weekend of
        hunting.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The team felt like they were in some strange kind of twilight zone. It
        was the wilderness, but not the kind they hoped for. They were glad to
        break camp and head back on to the Beaver Creek Trail.

      <p>
        After a short breakfast of the remaining pita bread and Robusto cheese,
        the team was ready to break camp. However, the weather conditions seemed
        a bit unsettling. There was a heavy fog covering the camp as far as they
        could see and were unsure whether it was going to rain. They left the
        last tent up in the event it would rain. By 7:45am, rain had not come
        and they decide to break camp and head home.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I thought the fog seemed to be moving off at first, but it was not so.
        There may have been a brief respite temporarily, but eventually it
        settled everywhere we could see, and it looked pretty thick. I thought
        for sure we'd be hiking in rain later that morning.&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As the team headed out for the last 6-7 miles of the trip, they made
        great time. As strange as it sounds, the team had faster paces as the
        trip progressed.
      </p>

        The team makes its ascent towards Mount Audubon trail head (at 11,375
        feet) and the fog seems to be breaking up, exposing beautiful blue
        skies. There would be no rain ahead for the rest of the trip.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Turns out we made the right call by breaking camp when we did. It had
        been a real gamble -- we could just as easily have gotten caught in
        rain, but we didn't. And as we approached our last summit, we could look
        back and see that the fog we were leaving behind was not going to
        disappear anytime soon. So if we had waited around for it to clear
        before breaking camp, well, we would have been waiting a long time.<br /><br />&ndash;

        The team arrives after a steep climb to their last summit at the Mount
        Audubon trail head. Remarkably, they find themselves above tree line and
        above a vast, dense cloud formation. As far as the eye can see, there is
        a cloud formation so dense and so consistent that it would appear that
        you could walk across it.

        We reach the end of the trail. Now all that remains is the hike back to
        the car..

        As we neared the end of our hike, we discussed how great our team had
        performed, and I pondered, Who else from MicroStrategy could have done
        this trip with us? A couple of potential candidates were mentioned, but
        I felt like we three were the perfect team for this and didn't need
        anyone else.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        The team arrives back at Long Lake parking lot after hiking along the
        road from Mitchell Lake parking lot. Let the rejoicing begin!
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        We took a picture at the Mitchell Lake parking lot, and discussed
        possible plans for lunch. Some of the team was very ready to eat, but we
        still had a walk to Long Lake ahead of us, so I suggested that we could
        forget about having lunch in town and instead rely on our remaining
        power bars. With a joyful sigh Glenn replied, 'I don't want another GD
        power bar!' and I cracked up. Amen, brother! We agreed to have lunch in
        Nederland.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The hike from the Mitchell Lake parking lot to the Long Lake parking lot
        was nothing compared to what we'd endured in the wild, but it was
        nevertheless frustrating for me. The final stretch was a slight uphill
        (on a paved road) and I had really just had it with walking. I knew I
        just had to be patient for a few more minutes, but boy, I was dying to
        get off my feet and get the backpack off.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I was just elated to find the car. We did it! We not only survived, but
        we really thrived! Our pace seemed to steadily increase throughout the
        trip. Our demeanors improved and our bodies strengthened.<br /><br />&ndash;

      <blockquote>
        Words cannot describe what a relief it was to finally get back to the
        car. Simply taking the pack off (for good) and sitting on a chair more
        comfortable than a boulder felt like a slice of heaven.<br /><br />&ndash;

        The team returns to Nederland to find lunch. On the way back, they see a
        cycling race up the steep mountain roads. They learn that it is part of
        a town celebration called "Miner's Day". As they enter town, there is an
        antique steam shovel being operated by a young child with musical
        accompaniment by a solo saxophonist playing through an amplifier. Quite
        an odd sight.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        When we saw the steam shovel and musician, I made Glenn laugh by quoting
        the always reliable Bill Murray line from Ghostbusters: 'Now there's
        something you don't see every day.' We even took a photo from the car as
        we drove by a 2nd time after lunch.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

        The team finds an excellent little Italian restaurant named Neo's. A
        large toothy Italian proprietor with an apron greets us as we enter his
        little dining room.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The food was really great. We had the spiciest garlic rolls I had ever
        eaten. Gunther and I ordered the house specialty: Lasagna. It was a huge
        plate. I can't believe we ate it all.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I remember saying that it felt odd to be inside a building again. It was
        so great to eat a real meal -- I'm sure it was quite good, but I think
        partly it was just great to eat anything other than camp food. The chef
        and the waiter were friendly. Glenn said, 'Nice town', and the chef
        replied, 'Yeah, unless you live here.' I remember thinking that the chef
        seemed to have trouble understanding Jitu. I figured maybe he didn't
        know many Indians? I remember him explaining to Jitu that 'panini' is
        just Italian for sandwich as if Jitu was a 4-year old, and I thought,
        this guy doesn't know who he's talking to, Jitu's probably one of the
        smartest people he'll ever meet!<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther

      <p>After lunch, we make our ways back to Denver by way of Boulder.</p>

        After checking into our hotel, and taking our first showers in days, we
        had all agreed that we would honor Gunther's wish to see the movie,
        "Inception". It was a great movie and the topic of dreams was all too
        surreal for Glenn.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As we walked into the theater, a preview was playing for a Will Ferrell
        movie called 'The Other Guys'. The moment we saw Will Ferrell appear
        on-screen, Glenn and I both began to crack up. For some reason, that's
        when it first started to sink in that I would soon have to say bye to
        Glenn &amp; Jitu. I really wished that we could now have several days
        together back in civilization of just chatting and laughing together. It
        was a sad realization, so I tried to just focus on the joy of returning
        to my wife &amp; kids.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Sitting in a dark, A/C cooled theater watching this powerful movie, I
        was struck by how unreal it felt. Our entire camping trip felt like a
        bizarre dream. Just twelve hours ago, we had been in the deep in
        wilderness after many days of strenuous backpacking.<br /><br />&ndash;
        Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        I too felt this was surreal; to suddenly be back in civilization, almost
        as if the past several days had never happened. Part of me wanted to run
        away back into the woods, but most of me was too tired and comfortable
        to even consider budging.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="toc36"><a name="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <blockquote>
        I feel this trip will leave an indelible mark on me: the intense
        physical burden of the climbs and the weight of the packs; the
        incredible power of nature at 11-12,000 feet; the beauty and solitude of
        the meadow, forests and mountains; and the mental discipline to not only
        execute the plan, but to adjust when things do not go as planned. It was
        a strenuous trip to do and our group was up to the task. I'm so proud of
        Gunther and Jitendra. For their first real camping trip, they did
        exceedingly well.<br /><br />&ndash; Glenn
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        This trip did exactly for me what I hoped it would. It took me out of my
        comfort zone, reminded me of how small our lives are in the face of
        nature, and renewed my appreciation for my life &amp; my friends. It
        also gave me a renewed confidence in my own competence, and left me
        impressed and humbled by Glenn &amp; Jitu's competence and strength. I
        was sad to say goodbye to them, but glad to be their friend and grateful
        to have shared this adventure together.<br /><br />&ndash; Gunther
