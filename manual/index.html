            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                budgetme is a Web-based application that allows you to manage
                one or more budgets. With it, you can do the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create any number of budgets. </strong>For most
                    people, one budget is enough. It is often your own personal
                    budget. If you live with another person, however, you may
                    need more than one: a <q>household</q> budget (to track
                    shared expenses, like utilities and food) and a
                    <q>personal</q> budget for your own spending. In these
                    cases, an <q>allowance</q> is given from the joint account
                    to each personal account.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="tip">

                    <p>
                        Keeping money separate between a <q>household</q> budget
                        and several <q>personal</q> budgets is a well-known good
                        practice for maintaining healthy relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As long as the couple agrees on a joint/shared budget,
                        each is free to spend within their own personal budget.

                    A <span class="term">transaction</span> is just like it
                    sounds: any transfer of money <em>into</em> or
                    <em>out of</em> your budget. This includes spending as well
                    as income from paychecks and any other form of reimbursement
                    or (monetary) gift.

                        To get the most value out of this tool, you should
                        record <strong>every</strong> transaction. This takes a
                        good amount of discipline and perseverence, but it
                        allows you to have a holistic view of all of your
                        spending.

                    of transactions together. For example, you can create a
                    category called <q>Eating Out</q> which records spending on
                    restaurants. Later, you can monitor how much you are

                    bounds that you've set for this budget.

                    You specify how much money of your income should go to each
                    category. This is how a budget works: if you spend within
                    the means that you establish, you will have enough funds for
                    all of your goals.

                <li class="skip-numbered-item">
                    You can easily change the amount of money you allocate for a
                    category, however, you must work within your available
                    income.

                    The normal category is one in which you intend to spend all
                    of its allotment during the course of a month. For example,
                    if you have a category for <q>Groceries,</q> you typically
                    expect to spend all of it each month. At the start of a new
                    month, you are given a new allotment for more groceries. The
                    balance of money you have at the end of the month goes into
                    the <span class="term">slush fund</span>. This includes a
                    surplus (extra money) and a deficit (overspending).

                    <p>
                        The slush fund is a system-defined category that
                        automatically receives surpluses (and deficits) from all
                        of your <q>normal</q> categories at the end of the
                        month. This can act as a safety measure for unexpected
                        spending.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A well managed budget keeps your slush fund
                        <q>in the black</q> (surplus). It can run a deficit, but
                        you can also fund it directly, if necessary.

                <li class="skip-numbered-item">
                    A <span class="term">subaccount</span> is a category where
                    you have to save up money for more than one month. For
                    example, you may have a bill that you owe every 6 months.
                    Rather than incur a big charge every time this occurs, you
                    save up 1/6 of the bill each month. When the bill comes, you
                    have the funds saved to pay it in full. The balance at the
                    end of the month is <strong>not</strong> added (or
                    subtracted) from the slush fund; it remains in the category.

                        A well-designed budget anticipates irregular payments
                        (i.e., ones that occur once or twice a year) and spreads
                        the cost evenly over each month.

                    For example, your dashboard can inform you of the following:

                        overspending (or near to overspending) on a category?
                        You can check whether you are <q>on track</q> to end the
                        month <strong>on budget</strong>.

                    By using budgetme over time, you'll be able to establish
                    better estimates for your spending habits. For example, you
                    may believe that you only need $600 a month for groceries.
                    However, by examining a year's worth of data, you'll know
                    more precisely whether this estimate is accurate.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="tip">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The best way to evolve your budget is to do
                        <q>end of year analyses.</q> This is the practice of
                        looking at how much money you spent in each category and
                        adjusting your future budget to reflect more realistic
                        goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you may learn that your estimates where too
                        aggressive and that meeting those spending goals was too
                        difficult. That's okay as long as you adjust future
                        spending by defunding some categories that are less
                        important.

            <h2>Money Flows</h2>
            <p>
                It is important to understand how money "flows" through your
                budget. The drawing below illustrates a budget with four
                categories (called
                <q>Normal #1</q>, <q>Normal #2</q>, <q>Subacct #1</q> and
                <q>Subacct #2</q>).

                    <q>funds</q> all of your categories. This is done
                    automatically for you once you establish a budget amount for
                    each category. You can see money <q>flowing</q> from
                    <span class="keyword">INCOME</span> category to each one you

                    Like the <span class="keyword">INCOME</span> category,
                    budgetme also creates a
                    <span class="keyword">SLUSH</span> category for you. At the
                    end of the month, any unspent money <q>goes to slush.</q> If
                    you happened to overspend in a given month, don&rsquo;t
                    worry--the <span class="keyword">SLUSH</span> category will
                    cover the difference.
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    This makes sense for many categories like
                    <q>Groceries</q> and many monthly utilities.

                <li>
                    <strong>Subaccounts maintain a balance over months.</strong>
                    Sometimes, you need a category to track a future bill that
                    occurs once a year. In this case, you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want the
                    balance at the end of the month to go back to the
                    <span class="keyword">SLUSH</span> category, but remain inside
                    it&rsquo;s own category. This allows you to see how the
                    funds accrue and enable you to pay that future bill without
