            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="product-name"></span> is a Web-based application
                that allows you to manage one or more budgets. With it, you can
                do the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create any number of budgets. </strong>For most
                    people, one budget is enough. It is often your own personal
                    budget. If you live with another person, however, you may
                    need more than one: a <q>household</q> budget (to track
                    shared expenses, like utilities and food) and a
                    <q>personal</q> budget for your own spending. In these
                    cases, an <q>allowance</q> is given from the joint account
                    to each personal account.

                        Keeping money separate between a <q>household</q> budget
                        and several <q>personal</q> budgets is a well-known good
                        practice for maintaining healthy relationships.

                    <p>
                        As long as the couple agrees on a joint/shared budget,
                        each is free to spend within their own personal budget.

                    A <span class="term">transaction</span> is just like it
                    sounds: any transfer of money <em>into</em> or
                    <em>out of</em> your budget. This includes spending as well
                    as income from paychecks and any other form of reimbursement

                        record <strong>every</strong> transaction. This takes a
                        good amount of discipline and perseverence, but it
                        allows you to have a holistic view of all of your

                    of transactions together. For example, you can create a
                    category called <q>Eating Out</q> which records spending on
                    restaurants. Later, you can monitor how much you are

                    You specify how much money of your income should go to each
                    category. This is how a budget works: if you spend within
                    the means that you establish, you will have enough funds for
                    all of your goals.

                    You can easily change the amount of money you allocate for a

                    The normal category is one in which you intend to spend all
                    of its allotment during the course of a month. For example,
                    if you have a category for <q>Groceries,</q> you typically
                    expect to spend all of it each month. At the start of a new
                    month, you are given a new allotment for more groceries. The
                    balance of money you have at the end of the month goes into
                    the <span class="term">slush fund</span>. This includes a
                    surplus (extra money) and a deficit (overspending).

                    <p>
                        The slush fund is a system-defined category that
                        automatically receives surpluses (and deficits) from all
                        of your <q>normal</q> categories at the end of the
                        month. This can act as a safety measure for unexpected
                        spending.

                    <p>
                        A well managed budget keeps your slush fund
                        <q>in the black</q> (surplus). It can run a deficit, but
                        you can also fund it directly, if necessary.

                    A <span class="term">subaccount</span> is a category where
                    you have to save up money for more than one month. For
                    example, you may have a bill that you owe every 6 months.
                    Rather than incur a big charge every time this occurs, you
                    save up 1/6 of the bill each month. When the bill comes, you
                    have the funds saved to pay it in full. The balance at the
                    end of the month is <strong>not</strong> added (or
                    subtracted) from the slush fund; it remains in the category.

                        (i.e., ones that occur once or twice a year) and spreads
                        the cost evenly over each month.

                        You can check whether you are <q>on track</q> to end the

                    By using <span class="product-name"></span> over time,
                    you'll be able to establish better estimates for your
                    spending habits. For example, you may believe that you only
                    need $600 a month for groceries. However, by examining a
                    year's worth of data, you'll know more precisely whether
                    this estimate is accurate.

                    <p>
                        The best way to evolve your budget is to do
                        <q>end of year analyses.</q> This is the practice of
                        looking at how much money you spent in each category and
                        adjusting your future budget to reflect more realistic
                        goals.

                    <p>
                        For example, you may learn that your estimates where too
                        aggressive and that meeting those spending goals was too
                        difficult. That's okay as long as you adjust future
                        spending by defunding some categories that are less
                        important.

            <p>
                It is important to understand how money "flows" through your
                budget. The drawing below illustrates a budget with four
                categories (called
                <q>Normal #1</q>, <q>Normal #2</q>, <q>Subacct #1</q> and

                    <strong>Subaccounts maintain a balance over months.</strong>
                    Sometimes, you need a category to track a future bill that
                    occurs once a year. In this case, you

                    <span class="keyword">SLUSH</span> category, but remain
                    inside it&rsquo;s own category. This allows you to see how
                    the funds accrue and enable you to pay that future bill
                    without affecting your monthly spending.

            <h2>Modes of operation</h2>
            <p>
                Before we get too deep into the mechanics of a budget, we should
                talk about the different ways that a user can interact with a
                budget. There are fundamentally three different
                <q>modes</q> of interacting with a budget:
            </p>
            <ol class="special">
                <li>
                    <strong>Defining and Configuring.</strong> This is the
                    process of deciding what categories your budget should
                    consist of and how much money you want to allocate to each.
                    It is the process of defining your payment methods
                    (identifying the bank account and credit cards that you want
                    to manage). It is also the process of identifying how much
                    money in your current bank account should go to paying the
                    next credit card bills and funding your subaccounts.
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    Typically, this is done once at the beginning, however, you
                    can always re-configure your budget over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tracking and Verifying.</strong> This is the process
                    of recording your transactions (a process I call "tracking")
                    and verifying your budget against bank statements. Each
                    statement may refer to a checking account, credit card or a
                    store card.
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    When we find new (unrecorded) transactions on one of these
                    statements, we add them to our budget. This gives us a
                    complete picture of your spending.
                    <span class="product-name"></span> produces its version of
                    each bank statement and you compare it for correctness. In
                    the end, the balances should be identical.
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    We can verify spending for each payment method, whether it
                    is a checking account, credit card or cash.
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    This is your day-by-day process where you ensure that you
                    are meeting your budget. It enables you to make good
                    decisions, like
                    <q>Should we go out for dinner tonight?</q> or
                    <q>Can I afford to purchase some new clothes?</q>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Forecasting and <q>Right-sizing.</q></strong> This
                    is done after you have several months of budget data and you
                    forecast future needs. For example, you can look at your
                    budget after six months and answer questions like,
                    <q
                        >If I follow this budget, will I have enough money saved
                        up for a downpayment on a car in a future month?</q
                    >
                </li>
                <li class="skip">
                    Often at the end of the calendar year, I like to review how
                    I did and correct my category allocations for the future
                    year. Maybe I had <em>overestimated</em> how much money I
                    would need for <q>Auto Maintenance.</q> Maybe there were too
                    many unexpected costs associated with our medical coverage.
                    Starting in January, I can have newly sized categories that
                    reflect my current habits and situation.

            </ol>
            <p>
                <span class="product-name"></span> assists you in each mode and
                places <q>controls</q> on who may perform these operations. For
                example, when you are in the mode of
                <q>Defining and Configuring,</q> you are essentially an
                <span class="keyword">Administrator</span>. If you are working
                with another person on a shared budget, you may want to grant
                this user the same permissions, but that is up to you. If you
                are <q>Tracking and Verifying,</q> you are in the mode of a
                <span class="keyword">Editor</span>. If you are doing
                <q>Forecasting and Right-sizing,</q> you are in the mode of a
                <span class="keyword">Viewer</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, it is worth noting that permissions are
                <q>inclusive</q> of lower ones. That is, if you are an
                <span class="keyword">Editor</span>, you also have the rights of
                the next lower level, which is a
                <span class="keyword">Viewer.</span> It would be hard to be an
                <span class="keyword">Editor</span> if you couldn't also view
                the data. Therefore, an
                <span class="keyword">Administrator</span> has all of the
                permissions of an <span class="keyword">Editor</span> and
                <span class="keyword">Viewer</span>, so choose the permissions
                you grant wisely!

            <h2>Getting Starting</h2>
            <p>
                Here&rsquo;s how you begin the process of defining and
                configuring your first budget.
            </p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Create a new Budget.</strong> Give your new budget a
                    name (and an optional description). This is just a simple
                    form and one click. Easy.

                    >
                    There are two steps. First, record how much money you will
                    have as income for this budget. We are looking for the
                    <strong>net</strong> dollar amount. Second, we need to
                    divide this income across a set of categories. Here, you
                    create a category and tell us:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the category.</li>
                    <li>
                        Whether it is a <q>normal</q> category or a subaccount.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much money you need. We can help you if your
                        category is based on a yearly bill and you want to save
                        up an equal portion each month.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li class="skip">
                    Your goal is to allocate all of your (net) income across all
                    of the categories. The remainder will go to your
                    <q>Slush</q> category.

                <li class="skip">

                                How do I know whether I should use a
                                <q>normal</q> category or a subaccount? If you
                                intend to spend all of the money in a category
                                in the course of a month, it should be a
                                <q>normal</q> category. Any overspending (or
                                underspending) is resolved by the Slush
                                category.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you need to save up over the course of one or
                                more months, you should mark your category as a
                                <q>subaccount.</q> In this case, any
                                overspending (or underspending) is maintained in
                                the category. Use this if you need to pay off a
                                bill on a frequency of two months to a year.

                                the bill becomes due. This makes it easier to
                                maintain your budget.

                    There are three <q>types</q> of payment methods: those that
                    you pay with a bank account (like a checking account), a
                    credit (or store) card and cash. While we can support many

                    try to match the balance of your credit card (and what the
                    issuer says) with what our budget says. If they don&rsquo;t
                    match up, then we are urged to find the missing transactions

                    Recall that a subaccount category may have a bill in a few
                    months. You can put aside money to each of these categories
